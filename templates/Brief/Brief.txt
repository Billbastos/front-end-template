Project Description:

This exercise is to develop the home screen of a fictitious agency website. The site has a number of pre-determined features based on each menu section (eg. Top-slider, Product and team).

The site is intended to be broadly appealing and easy to use, not directed specifically towards a tech savvy user demographic.
While keeping in mind the sites overall structure and navigation. If you need to code and additional features you think are neccesary, go for it.

Features:
Elements and features on the home screen should include, but are not limited to:

	⁃	jQuery Carousel
	⁃	CSS effects
	⁃	Javascript
	⁃	Responsiveness

Your timeframe is 3 days; it’s up to you to figure out how to structure the process! When you are finished please send back your working files to me.

What we are looking for:

	⁃	HTML5, CSS / Sass and Javascript / Jquery Skills!
	⁃	Use of any responsive framework, such as Bootstrap, Foundation or whatever you are comfortable with.
	⁃	Ability to take mock-ups and make it as pixel perfect as possible.
